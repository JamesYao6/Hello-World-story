Friday, I am walking to school but I didn't finish my homework. I am considering skipping class for doing homework. When I arrived I see a pretty girl walk in to my classroom.
Then I see Leonardo DiCaprio enter the room. Leo is followed by Mickey
 Mouse. What? This is crazy! 

"Leo! I loved you in Titanic!" I had to yell it out. 

"Thanks, kid! Hey! can you do me a favor?"

"Yeah! What is it?"

"Do you know what is the answer for the second question?" Leo asked.

"I just enrolled into your class to get a better feeling of how it is like to be a college student now for my next role."

"I...I..I, wow, sorry for my stuttering but I am just stunned that you, Leo are here in real life in front of me... I just
want to say that I am big fan... Oops, now back to your question... I actually haven't finished my homework so I may not 
be of much help for you." I stutterd and am trying to process this wild moment that is happening to me right now.

Now that is how Leonardo DiCaprio became my roommate.
