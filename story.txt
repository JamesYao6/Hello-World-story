Friday, I am walking to school but I didn't finish my homework. I am considering skipping class for doing homework. When I arrived I see a pretty girl walk in to my classroom.
Then I see Leonardo DiCaprio enter the room. Leo is followed by Mickey
 Mouse. What? This is crazy! 

"Leo! I loved you in Titanic!" I had to yell it out. 

"Thanks, kid! Hey! can you do me a favor?"

"Yeah! What is it?"
